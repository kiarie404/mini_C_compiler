If we are going to hardcode, then we need to 
  1. Make this code as modular as posssible
  2. Agree on the pseudocode of each module before assigning them to anyone
  3. Agree on the API function calls from each module
  4. Any one who does not participate in the code... flunked out of the group.
  
My proposition :
  We meet at 2:00pm : where we will -
      - design the modules
      - agree on the pseudocode
      - assign tasks
  
  From here on we meet everyday, to check where we are...(a brief 15min max meeting, so be in time - ( not on time ))
    - To check where the person assigned is
    - discuss how the modules may change
    
  We have to finish this on Sunday hopefully, 
  No participation == Out of group . Sad but necessary
