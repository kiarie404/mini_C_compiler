This program does not cover our BNF, instead it covers the BNF defined in the File called - "grammar.md"

Let us work with a small language first,
Understand the code presented here ,later we can start handling our own complex BNF.
There is no way we are not presenting anything tomorrow... we got this.

- grammar.md
- read_me.md
- test_parser.py - outputs the syntax tree in the form of a python dictionary
                 - outputs a json file called - syntax_tree_representation
                 - This is because a json file can be converted to a visual presentation here : https://vanya.jp.net/vtree/
