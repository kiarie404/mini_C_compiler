QUESTION:
Build an ICG that generates 3-address code(quadruaples or any other valid Representation)based on the ouput of syntax analyzer(Parser) 

Main Idea: 
Parse Tree to TAC(Three-address-Code) then to IR(Intermediate Representation- In this caeI choose Quadruaples)

Class TAC 
    #For generating the TAC 

Class Quadruaple 
    #For Representing the Three Address code in a visualization typa way.
    # Still finding out a way I can make it a pretty graphical table like the picture below
